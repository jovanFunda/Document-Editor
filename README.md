Document Editor is a Java project that I have been working on for 4 months, it was part of a Software Design course in my university

On this project, our primary goal was to focus on Design Patterns and implementing them..
We covered alot of them such as command pattern, observer, state, factory, singleton and many more while working on MVC architecture.
